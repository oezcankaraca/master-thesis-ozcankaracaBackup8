/**
 * The FileSenderHandler class is a specialized Netty channel handler used for sending files over a network.
 * Extending the SimpleChannelInboundHandler class, it is designed to efficiently handle the process of reading
 * a file from the local file system and sending it over a network channel. This class is integral in scenarios
 * where file distribution or data dissemination is required in a distributed network system.
 *
 * This handler can be associated with either a super-peer or a lectureStudioServer, allowing it to be versatile
 * in different network roles. Upon activation of the channel, the handler reads the specified file and streams it
 * over the network to the connected peer. It keeps track of the start time to calculate the duration of the file
 * transfer, providing important metrics for network performance analysis.
