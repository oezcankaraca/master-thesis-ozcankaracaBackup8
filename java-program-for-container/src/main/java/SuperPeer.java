 * The SuperPeer class represents a key component in a distributed network system,

 * sending and receiving files among peers in a network. It implements both the  server side, 
 * which sends files to other peers, and the client side, which receives files from the lecutreStudio-server.
 *
 * Utilizing the Netty library for network operations, this class is configured to
 * listen on specific ports for server and client operations. It manages the network
 * connection duration and file transfer duration to measure and analyze network performance.
 * Additionally, it has mechanisms for managing connection status, including retrying
 * connection attempts and synchronizing file transfer processes.
