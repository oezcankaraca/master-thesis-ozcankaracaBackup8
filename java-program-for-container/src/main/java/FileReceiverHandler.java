/**
 * The FileReceiverHandler class is a Netty channel handler specifically designed for receiving files over a network.
 * Extending the SimpleChannelInboundHandler class, it efficiently handles the data received from a network channel,
 * writing it to a specified file path. This class plays a crucial role in network-based file transfer operations,
 * making it a key component in distributed systems where file sharing or data exchange is required.
 *
 * This handler supports functionality for both the Peer and SuperPeer classes,
 * making it versatile for various network roles. Upon activation of the channel,
 * it initializes the file output stream to start receiving the data.
 * As the data arrives, it writes the bytes to the file and keeps track of the total number of bytes received.
 * Upon completion of the file transfer, it calculates the transfer duration,
 * logs the details, and notifies the associated peer or super-peer instance.
