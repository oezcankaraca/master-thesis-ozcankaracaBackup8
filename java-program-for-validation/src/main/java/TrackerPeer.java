/**
 * The TrackerPeer class acts as a server in a distributed system to track and confirm
 * peer connections. It listens for incoming connections on a specified port and expects
 * to receive confirmation messages from client peers. Upon receiving a confirmation,
 * it increments a counter. The class is designed to measure the time taken to receive
 * confirmations from all expected peers in the network.
 * 
 * It starts counting time from the moment the first confirmation is received until the last
 * expected confirmation, allowing for the calculation of the total duration needed for all
 * peers to successfully send their confirmation. 
 * The number of expected confirmations (peers) is defined by an environment variable,
 * allowing for dynamic adjustment based on the deployment setup.
